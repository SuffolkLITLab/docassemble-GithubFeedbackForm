  ########## How to use this file #################
  
  1. Create a new GitHub user and create a personal access token on it.
  1. Edit your config, and create a block like this:
        username: "YOUR_NEW_DEDICATED_ISSUE_CREATION_ACCOUNT"
        token: "..." # A valid GitHub personal access token associated with the username above
        default repository owner: YOUR_GITHUB_USER_OR_ORG_HERE
        allowed repository owners: # List the repo that your account will be allowed to create issues on
          - YOUR_GITHUB_USER_OR_ORG_HERE 
          - SECOND_GITHUB_USER_OR_ORG
  2. Add a link on each page, in the footer or `under` area.    
  3. Optionally, create your own feedback.yml file. It should look like this:
        include:
          - docassemble.GithubFeedbackForm:feedback.yml
